(* [make_test] is a helper function that creates a test case for funciton 
    [f] with the input [argument] and the [expected] ouput. [test_info] gives
    test information, useful for identifying the test case in the error 
    message if the test is not passed. *)

(* 4, count count_occurrences*)
(* The test suite below includes the tests for an empty list and an 
unsorted list, with the latter returning an exception. Check how
the exception is tested, and refer to textbook section 3.10 
for more information.*)

  make_test "empty list" count_occurrences ([], (Failure "")) [];
  "not sortd exception" >:: ((fun _ -> assert_raises (Failure "not sorted") 
  (fun () -> count_occurrences (["b"; "a"], (Failure "not sorted")))));
]
(* Another test for count_occurences: 
Argument: (["a"; "a"; "b"], (Failure ""))
Expected value: [("b", 1); ("a", 2)] or [("a", 2); ("b", 1)]

Our problem specification allows any order in the resulting 
list, as long as it contains the correct items. Choose the order 
for the expected value in your own test aligns with your codeâ€™s 
logic, and be sure to understand why your code produces the 
result list in that particular order.

Also, add more tests *)
