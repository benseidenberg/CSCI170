 (* provided helper function that deduplicates a list *)
let dedup xs = List.sort_uniq compare xs

(* provided helper function that sorts a given list *)
let sort xs = List.sort compare xs

(* provided helper function to convert a float to a string *)
(* OCaml's string_of_float is not quite RFC compliant due to its tendency
   to output whole numbers with trailing decimal points without a zero.
   But, printf does the job how we want. *)

(* provided helper operator that does function composition.*)  
let ( @@ ) f g x = f (g x)

(* Add OCaml-style documentation comments to each function above 
   its definition. Please don't include excessive comments in the
   function bodies.
   Refer to the online textbook section 2.5 for more information.
